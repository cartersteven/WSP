        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="intro">
            I am a Web Development Student in Melbourne, FL. I am proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. On this page you can see some of my work and theory on different components and methods. 
        </p>
        <section>
            <h3>
                Header with links
            </h3>
            <img src="images/header.jpg" />
            <h4>
                What I hope to learn
            </h4>
            <p>
                I hope to learn how to create a good-looking header. Most of my work with headers to date has been very plain by comparison with many of today’s trends. I hope to modernize my understanding of headers and their design. 
            </p>
            <h4>
                How this relates to what I have/will learn in WDD
            </h4>
            <p>
                This will help my future in WDD because I will be able to make a header that looks like it belongs in this decade, and not one from the early 2000's. I also believe it will compliment what I have learned about developing headers.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Create a <code>header</code> that spans the entire width of the top of the page, creating the <strong>component</strong></li>
                <li>Set an <code>img</code> as the <strong>logo</strong> in the middle and center it using <strong>CSS</strong></li>
                <li>Use <code>span</code>s to create the <strong>links</strong>, and use <strong>CSS</strong> to add background images and styling to them.</li>
