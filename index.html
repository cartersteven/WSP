        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="intro">
            I am a Web Development Student in Melbourne, FL. I am proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. On this page you can see some of my work and theory on different components and methods. 
        </p>
        <section>
            <h3>
                Header with links
            </h3>
            <img src="images/header.jpg" />
            <h4>
                What I hope to learn
            </h4>
            <p>
                I hope to learn how to create a good-looking header. Most of my work with headers to date has been very plain by comparison with many of todayâ€™s trends. I hope to modernize my understanding of headers and their design. 
            </p>
            <h4>
                How this relates to what I have/will learn in WDD
            </h4>
            <p>
                This will help my future in WDD because I will be able to make a header that looks like it belongs in this decade, and not one from the early 2000's. I also believe it will compliment what I have learned about developing headers.
            </p>
            <h4>
                How would I build this?
            </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Create a <code>header</code> that spans the entire width of the top of the page, creating the <strong>component</strong>.</li>
                <li>Set an <code>img</code> as the <strong>logo</strong> in the middle and center it using <strong>CSS</strong>.</li>
                <li>Use <code>span</code>s to create the <strong>links</strong>, and use <strong>CSS</strong> to add background images and styling to them.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>
                Prominent Sub-Navigation
            </h3>
            <img src="images/subnav.png" />
            <h4>
                What I hope to learn
            </h4>
            <p>
                Most subnavigation is vary nondescriptive of what it will take you to. I hope to learn to make a subnavigation that helps users to know exactly what they are selecting. The use of images and a short paragraph will accomplish this feat. 
            </p>
            <h4>
                How this relates to what I have/will learn in WDD
            </h4>
            <p>
                This component will help me learn to separate my website's purposes into easily found and utilized sections. It helps create a better user experience and facilitates faster user retention of the purpose and function of the website.
            </p>
            <h4>
                How would I build this?
            </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Create a <code>section</code> that defines the shape of the <strong>component</strong>.</li>
                <li>Create a <code>ul</code> which contains all of the subnavigation sections within each <code>li</code>.</li>
                <li>Fill each <code>li</code> with a <code>h2</code> at the top, followed by an <code>img</code> that describes the function or use of that part of the site, a <code>p</code> that describes in detail the function of that section, and  an <code>a</code> which contains the link to the part of the site in question.</li>
